skele-cli
=========

*A skeleton command line program in Python.*


## Purpose

This is a skeleton application which demonstrates how to properly structure a
Python CLI application.

I've done my best to structure this in a way that makes sense for *most* users,
but if you have any feedback, please open a Github issue and I'll take a look.

The idea with this project is that you should be able to use this as a template
for building new CLI apps.

You can fork this project and customize it to your liking, or just use it as a
reference.
